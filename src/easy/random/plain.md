# Plain English Solution
Have a function with the parameters min and max
Use Math.random() to declare a random number within the range
Output the random number using console.log


First idea but bad:
<!-- We can use date.now() to generate a time

We can then loop through the date.now() time until we get a number that is within the range of the min and max -->
