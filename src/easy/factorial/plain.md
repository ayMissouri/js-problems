# Plain English Solution
We will create a function that lets the user input a number they would like the factor of, we will then have a variable that keeps track of the number followed by and if statement to check if the number is 0 or 1, if the number is 0 or 1 then we will have it return it as the final answer. If the number is not 0 or 1 we will have an else statement that has a for loop which multiplys the sum by the index of the for loop, the for loop index will start at the number they have given and will go down by 1 everytime it comepletes a cycle. We then return the final sum.
