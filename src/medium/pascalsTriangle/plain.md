# Plain English Solution
We will create a function with a row amount input inside the function we will have an empty array for us to push numbers into later down the line, then we will create a for loop that continues for the amount of rows that have been input. The for loop will first declare what row the triangle starts on and is currently on and then an if statement will check if to make sure the index is greater than 1 and inside that there will be another for loop that will continue until the index is less than the length of the array we made earlier, after that we will push the next number into the current row array and after that we will push another 1 into it so it follows the pattern of the pascals triangle, then after that it will repeat until it has done 10 full cycles on which it will then return the final array.
