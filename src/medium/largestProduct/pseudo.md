# Pseudo Code Solution
create function with digit input
variable that hold the 1000 digit number
variable that hold the the beiggest sum
variable that hold the array that produced the biggest sum
create a for loop that checks every possible sequence of numbers 
    create a loop that takes a given sequence of numbers and check if their sum is the highest yet
    if so store the sum and array that produced the number
return the sum and log the array that produced the highest sum
