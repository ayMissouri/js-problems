# Pseudo Code Solution
create a function with single number input
    create a empty array to store amicable numbers in
    create a variable to keep track of the sum
    create a for loop that devides the given number by every number form 0-the given number
        make a if check to see if the result of a given division is an integer
            if so add it to the sum and the array 
        else do ignore that number
log the array for debugging
return the sum as result
