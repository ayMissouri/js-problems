# Pseudo Code Solution
create function no input required
create num1 and num2 to keep track of the numbers that need to be added together
create an empty array to keep track of the fibonacci numbers
    create for loop that runs 100 times
        add num1 to num2 
         then set num1 to num2 and set num2 to the result
        push result to array
return the array
